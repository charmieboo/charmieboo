## Hi, I am Charmaine. ğŸ‘‹

### About Me
ğŸ“š I am a first-year undergraduate student at University of London, studying Data Science and Business Analytics.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently (always) learning SQL, Python and Tableau.

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Danny Ma's 8 Weeks SQL Challenge, and my daily dose of DataLemur questions!

ğŸ’¬ I love learning new technologies, and solving problems.
